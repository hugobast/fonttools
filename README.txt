TTX/TTLib 1.0a5


You need the following software to use TTX/TTLib:

- Python 1.5.1 or newer 1.5.2. Version 1.5.2 is here:
    http://www.python.org/1.5/
  
  on Windows: grab the Windows installer, run the full install
  on Un*x: follow the build instructions
  on Linux: maybe you already *have* Python: check whether you have
  version 1.5.1 or newer.
  on MacOS: grab the installer, run "Easy Install"

- The Numeric Python extension (you don't need this under MacOS, since it's
  included with the MacPython installer).
  
  The compiled Win32 version:
    ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/LLNLDistribution.zip

  The source distribution is here:
    ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/LLNLDistribution.tgz

  Included in this archive is a directory called "Numeric" (but do unzip 
  the whole archive, it's needed for the install script!). 
  On Linux or other Unices: follow the build instructions.
  
  On Windows & Unix:
  In the "Numeric" directory there is a script called "installthis.py". 
  If you've installed Python successfully, you can just run it, it will 
  install (copy!) the neccesary stuff to the Python directory all by itself.

- xmlproc (a Python based XML parser) from:
    http://www.stud.ifi.uio.no/~larsga/download/python/xml/xmlproc.html

  I don't know the official install procedure, but the archive should contain 
  a directory called "xml", move that directory to the Python directory and 
  you should be all set. To make sure: start python (python.exe on Win32) 
  and type at the ">>>" prompt:
  
  >>> import xml.parsers.xmlproc.xmlproc
  
  followed by a return. If that doesn't cause an error, you're all set.


Oof. Almost there. Now run the "install.py" script from the TTX archive. 
This will make sure Python knows where to find TTLib. It doesn't copy anything.
(Note that the "install.py" script has only been lightly tested.)

Additional Mac instructions:
De-binhex "TTX.rsrc.hqx" by dropping it onto StuffIt expander. (Or use your
own preferred method ;-)
The "TTX.py" script included in this archive is the Mac-only main program: 
Drop it onto the "BuildApplet" app inside the Python folder; this will 
produce the TTX applet.

For Unix and DOS I've provided two command line programs:
	- tt2xml.py
	- xml2tt.py
They do pretty much what you'd expect. They take one or two arguments: an input 
file name and optionally an output file name.
If you don't provide an output file name, an output file name will be contructed 
from the input file name: foo.ttf becomes foo.xml in tt2xml.py and vice versa 
for xml2tt.py. WARNING: these tools will silently overwrite existing files!
Adam Twarloch contributed a Windows registry file (ttffile.reg) which
makes the two obove tools available under the Right Mouse Button. You will
need to edit the paths in this file according to your installation: the
file is just an example! Ideally the correct file could be generated by
the install.py script.

To learn more about using TTLib, read the comments and documentation in
TTLib/ttlib/__init__.py; to learn more about writing table converters, read
TTLib/ttlib/tables/table_API_readme.txt.

That's it so far! Thanks for your efforts, it's much appreciated. If you 
encounter any problems, or if you have any questions, be sure to let me know: 
just@letterror.com. Oh, I'd be happy to hear success stories, too...
