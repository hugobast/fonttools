TTX/FontTools is a suite of tools and libraries for manipulating fonts. 

It currently reads and writes TrueType font files, reads PostScript Type 1 fonts and more. It contains two command line programs to convert TrueType fonts to an XML based format (called TTX) and back. 

If you let setup to create desktop icons during installation, icons for ttdump.exe, ttcompile.exe and ttlist.exe will be created. You will be able to drop a TTF or OTF file onto the ttlist.exe or ttdump.exe icon to dump the font into an TTX file that is in XML format. You will be also able to drop a TTX file onto the ttcompile.exe icon to build a TTF or OTF font. 

Please note that you can only drag-n-drop one file onto the FontTools icons. Dropping multiple files won't work in this version!
